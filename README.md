# Design-Patterns-in-Java
This repository contains Java implementations of various design patterns. 
Each directory represents a category of design patterns along with example implementations.
These patterns provide solutions to common design problems and can enhance the flexibility and maintainability of your code.

## Features

### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. 
It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.


### Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, 
thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. 
It also provides support for undoable operations.


### Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, 
either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects 
from the same class.


### Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects but 
lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.


### Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects 
so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.


### Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.


### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- Various implementations of the Singleton pattern, such as `BillPughSingleton`, `EagerSingleton`, `LazySingleton`, `StaticBlockSingleton`, and `ThreadSafeSingleton`, demonstrate different ways to create singletons.

### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
